# Problem 1


Suppose we have the following matrix:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
A = matrix(rnorm(4*3),nrow=4,ncol=3)
```
We want to get the column mean for each column of the matrix $A$.  Do this using each of the following techniques:

### Part a
Hard coding  (that is, write $(A[1,1]+ A[2,1] + ...)/4, ...$  )

```{r}
#SOLUTION
cm1 = (A[1,1]+A[2,1]+A[3,1]+A[4,1])/4
cm2 = (A[1,2]+A[2,2]+A[3,2]+A[4,2])/4
cm3 = (A[1,3]+A[2,3]+A[3,3]+A[4,3])/4
sprintf ("mean of column1 = %s" , cm1)
sprintf ("mean of column2 = %s" , cm2)
sprintf ("mean of column3 = %s" , cm3)
```

### Part b
For loop(s)
```{r}
#SOLUTION
for (ci in 1:3){
  ct = 0
  for (ri in 1:4){
    ct = ct+A[ri,ci]
  }
  cm=ct/4
  print (paste("mean of column",ci, " = " ,cm))
  # I dont know why sprintf doesnt work
}
```

### Part c
The apply (or related) function 
```{r}
#SOLUTION
print  (mean(A[,1]))
print  (mean(A[,2]))
print  (mean(A[,3]))
```

# Problem 2

Many statistical methods can be computed/analyzed using the SVD\footnote{For this question,
	I'm using common linear algebra notation of $A$, $x$, and $b$. This $x$ is not to be confused with a feature}. 
	Let's look at solving least squares problems as they are fundamental to modern data analysis.

### Part a

```{r}
set.seed(10)
A = matrix(rnorm(24), nrow=6, ncol=4)
A[,1] = 1
```

Write $A = UDV^{\top}$ (that is, form svd.out = svd(A)).  
			
Suppose we wish to solve for $\hat{x} = arg\min_x ||Ax - b||_2^2 = (A^{\top}A)^{-1}A^{\top}b$ for $b = (1,2,3,4,5,6)^{\top}$.   As an aside, to show this, note that\footnote{$\nabla_x$ indicates gradient with respect to $x$}
		\begin{align}
		||Ax - b||_2^2 & = x^{\top}A^{\top}Ax + b^{\top}b -2x^{\top}A^{\top}b \\
		&  \Rightarrow \nabla_x  = 2A^{\top}A\hat{x} - 2 A^{\top}b \stackrel{\textrm{set}}{=} 0 \\
		& \Rightarrow \hat{x} = (A^{\top}A)^{-1} A^{\top}b
		\end{align}

		How can I solve this using the SVD?  Here, let's follow the steps:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Form $U^{\top} b$
			\item Solve $Dw = U^{\top} b$
			\item Form $\hat{x} = Vw$
		\end{enumerate}
		Produce this $\hat{x}$ in R via this method.  Note that in this particular case, all the singular values in $D$
		are nonzero and hence $\hat{x} = VD^{-1}U^{\top}b$.

```{r}
#SOLUTION
b = matrix(1:6)
svd= svd(A)
x_hat = svd$v%*%solve(diag(svd$d))%*%t(svd$u)%*%b
ss = solve(t(A)%*%A)%*%t(A)%*%b
x_hat
```

### Part b
Suppose instead we have observations under the model $Y = \mathbb{X}\beta +\epsilon$, where $Y = b$ 
	and $\mathbb{X} = A$.  Using the R function lm and predict, what is the least squares solution $\hat\beta$ and the fitted values $\hat{Y}$ for $Y$ using the least squares solution?\footnote{Remember to not have R add an intercept as there is already a column of ones}  
	
How does the produced coefficient vector $\hat{\beta}$ compare the $\hat{x}$?
```{r}
#SOLUTION
lm(b~A -1)
# There are the same
```

# Problem 3
Now, let's look at a new $A$
```{r}
set.seed(100)
A = matrix(rnorm(4*3),ncol=4,nrow=3)
A[,1] = 1

```
and $b = (1,2,3)^{\top}$. This is an example of an \emph{underdetermined} system.  
	
	
	
### Part a
What do(es) the corresponding $\hat{x}$ look like using the SVD? What do(es) the $\hat\beta$ look like using lm?

```{r}
#SOLUTION
b = matrix(1:3)
svd= svd(A)
xhat_svd = svd$v%*%solve(diag(svd$d))%*%t(svd$u)%*%b
ss = solve(t(A)%*%A,tol = 1e-20)%*%t(A)%*%b
  xhat_svd
b_hat = matrix(lm(b~A -1)[[1]])
b_hat
# there are not same because ncol>nrow, which means p>n
```

### Part b
What do(es) the corresponding $A\hat{x}$ look like using the SVD? What do(es) the $\hat{Y} = \mathbb{X}\hat\beta$ look like using predict?
```{r}
#SOLUTION
ax = A%*%xhat_svd
ax
b_hat[4] = 0 #matrix time doesnt deal with NA
y_hat = A%*%b_hat
y_hat
```
NOTE: it is worth considering why the two objects have different formatting.


### Part c
Though this  is just one simulated example and not a proof, your findings generalize to all situations when $p > n$. Summarize in words what these findings are.

SOLUTION: 
To solve the equation:$\hat{x} = arg\min_x ||Ax - b||_2^2, when p>n, there are infinte b solution could make ||Ax - b||_2^2 = 0

# Problem 4

```{r}
set.seed(1)
n = 2000
p = 500
X = matrix(rnorm(n*p),nrow=n,ncol=p)
X[,1] = 1
format(object.size(X),units='auto')#memory used by X

b = rep(0,p)
b[1:5] = 25
b_0 = 0
Xdf = data.frame(X)
Y = b_0 + X %*% b + rnorm(n)
hatBeta = coef(lm(Y~X-1)) #Here, the [-1] ignores the intercept

#Using out-of-core technique
write.table(X[1:500,],file='Xchunk1.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=names(Xdf))
write.table(X[501:1000,],file='Xchunk2.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=names(Xdf))
write.table(X[1001:1500,],file='Xchunk3.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=names(Xdf))
write.table(X[1501:2000,],file='Xchunk4.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=names(Xdf))
write.table(Y[1:500],file='Ychunk1.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=F)
write.table(Y[501:1000],file='Ychunk2.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=F)
write.table(Y[1001:1500],file='Ychunk3.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=F)
write.table(Y[1501:2000],file='Ychunk4.txt',sep=',',row.names=F,col.names=F)
```
### Part a
Report the first 5 entries in $\hat\beta$ (that is, hatBeta in the above code) using lm on all the data simultaneously

```{r}
#SOLUTION
hatBeta[1:5]
```

### Part b
Alternatively, we can read in each chunk and update the solution using biglm. Here is the first part. Complete the procedure in the natural way on the remaining chunks. Compare the first 5 entries in $\hat\beta$ formed by this method with the entries in (a)
```{r}
if(!require(biglm,quietly=TRUE)){
  install.packages('biglm',repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org');require(biglm)
}

# Chunk 1
Xchunk = read.table(file='Xchunk1.txt',sep=',',header=T)
Ychunk = scan(file='Ychunk1.txt',sep=',')
form = as.formula(paste('Ychunk ~ -1 + ',paste(names(Xchunk),collapse=' + '),collapse=''))
out.biglm = biglm(formula = form,data=Xchunk)
hatBeta[1:5]
coef(out.biglm)[1:5]

# Chunk 2
Xchunk = read.table(file='Xchunk2.txt',sep=',',header=T)
Ychunk = scan(file='Ychunk2.txt',sep=',')
out.biglm = update(out.biglm,moredata=Xchunk)
hatBeta[1:5]
coef(out.biglm)[1:5]

# Chunk 3
Xchunk = read.table(file='Xchunk3.txt',sep=',',header=T)
Ychunk = scan(file='Ychunk3.txt',sep=',')
out.biglm = update(out.biglm,moredata=Xchunk)
hatBeta[1:5]
coef(out.biglm)[1:5]

## Can you figure out the final steps? Have we updated on all of the chunks?


print(hatBeta[1:5])
print(coef(out.biglm)[1:5])
```


# Problem 5
Forward selection.

### Part a

Using the $\mathbb{X}$ and $Y$ generated in the previous problem, use forward selection and AIC to estimate $b$.
 
```{r}
if(!require(leaps)){install.packages('leaps',repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org');require(leaps)}
```


### Part b (optional)
Save the $\mathbb{X}$ generated in the previous problem to a .csv file.  Using forward selection and AIC, estimate $b$ without having $\mathbb{X}$ stored in memory. Verify that your answer matches (a) 
```{r}
#Solution 
lm = lm(Y~X-1)
out.aic = stepAIC(lm, direction = "forward", intercept=False)
hatBeta[1:5]
coef(out.aic)[1:5]
#exactlly the same
```

# Problem 6 (optional)
On the first set of lecture notes, we covered an example for predicting punctuation given 
a male user has entered the phrase ``thank you''.  We computed the loss for two different 
procedures $\hat{f}_1$ and $\hat{f}_2$.  Now, we want to compute the risk, which is the
expected value of the loss.

As a review, suppose a random variable $Z$ takes a value 1 with probability $\pi$ and 0
with probability $1-\pi$, where $0 \leq \pi \leq 1$. Then
\[ 
\mathbb{E}Z = 1 * \pi + 0 * (1 - \pi) = \pi.
\]

Compute the following risks.  
```{r}
```

### Part a
\begin{align*}
R(\hat{f}_1) = \mathbb{E}\ell(\hat{f}_1(X),Y) & = \ldots \\
\end{align*}
```{r}
```
### Part b
\begin{align*}
R(\hat{f}_2) = \mathbb{E}\ell(\hat{f}_2(X),Y) & = \ldots \\
\end{align*}
